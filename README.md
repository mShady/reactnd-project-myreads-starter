# MyReads Project

This is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

I'm working on this as part of [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The code is only for the front end part. Backend is provided, separately by Udacity at https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com

It has mainly two screens:

## List Page

Which list the Shelves (read, currently reading, or want to read) with the books on each of them

## Search Page

Where the user search for books (that might or might not be on shelves) based on the list of key words listed here: [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md)
